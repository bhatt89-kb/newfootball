# StadiumOS GenAI

**A GenAI-enabled stadium operations & fan-experience console, built for the FIFA World Cup 2026.**

Submitted to **Hack2Skill — Virtual Prompt War: Challenge 4**.

> Ana, the multilingual assistant at the center of this console, answers navigation, accessibility,
> crowd-safety, transport, sustainability, and emergency questions for fans, volunteers, staff, and
> organizers — and every one of those answers keeps working even if the AI provider goes down mid-match.

## 1. Problem statement

FIFA World Cup 2026 will be the largest World Cup ever staged: 48 teams, 104 matches, 16 host cities across
three countries, and stadiums built or expanded to hold 60,000–90,000+ fans who speak dozens of languages
and arrive with wildly different mobility, sensory, and accessibility needs. On a single matchday, a host
venue has to simultaneously solve:

- **Navigation** — tens of thousands of fans finding gates, seats, restrooms, and services they've never
  seen before, often under time pressure.
- **Crowd management** — concourses and gates that can go from comfortable to dangerous in minutes as a
  match kicks off or ends.
- **Accessibility** — fans with mobility, vision, hearing, or sensory needs who need accurate, judgment-free
  guidance, not a generic FAQ.
- **Transportation** — shuttle, transit, and parking information that changes hour to hour.
- **Sustainability** — a tournament under real pressure to reduce its environmental footprint.
- **Multilingual assistance** — a genuinely global crowd, not just English/Spanish speakers.
- **Operational intelligence & real-time decision support** — control-room staff who need the single most
  important fact first, not a wall of dashboards.

Most existing stadium apps solve one of these in isolation (a static wayfinding map, a translated PDF, a
push-notification system) and none of them adapt to the actual question a fan or operator has *right now*.
**StadiumOS GenAI is a single, extensible platform that puts a GenAI reasoning layer over deterministic,
safety-critical operational logic**, so it gets the benefits of natural-language understanding and
multilingual fluency without ever letting a hallucination compromise a safety decision.

**Key architectural decision — "GenAI as a narrator, not a decision-maker":**
every safety- or fact-critical decision (crowd severity thresholds, wheelchair-accessible pathfinding,
emergency escalation) is computed by deterministic code first. GenAI is then used to turn that verified
output into a natural, multilingual, context-aware response. If the AI provider is slow, down, rate-limited,
or simply not configured (no API key), every endpoint **still returns a correct, safe answer** — just
without the AI-generated prose polish. This is verified directly by the test suite (see `TESTING.md`) and
is why the app is fully demoable offline.

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for endpoint-by-endpoint detail.

## 4. Quick start

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # optional but recommended
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Optionally set GOOGLE_API_KEY in .env for live GenAI responses.
# The app runs correctly with an empty key — see "GenAI as a narrator" above.
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000/api/docs` for interactive OpenAPI documentation.

### Frontend

The frontend is a single static file with no build step.

```bash
cd frontend
python -m http.server 8080
```

Visit `http://localhost:8080`. It will auto-detect whether the backend at `http://localhost:8000` is
reachable; if not, it runs entirely on local, in-browser fallback logic so judges/reviewers can evaluate
the UX with zero setup.

To point the frontend at a different backend URL, set `window.STADIUMOS_API_BASE` before `index.html`'s
script runs (e.g. in a small inline `<script>` tag added to the page, or via a hosting platform's
environment injection).

### Tests

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing
```

71 tests currently pass with 78% line coverage and zero external network calls (the AI layer is exercised
through dependency injection / monkeypatching, never a live API call — see `docs/TESTING.md`).

### Docker

```bash
cd backend
docker build -t stadiumos-genai-backend .
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env stadiumos-genai-backend
```

## 6. Why this should score well against the stated parameters

- **Code quality** — typed Pydantic schemas end-to-end, single-responsibility service modules, zero
  duplicated business logic between routers, `ruff`-clean, consistent docstrings explaining *why*, not
  just *what*.
- **Security** — rate limiting, security headers, strict input validation, prompt-injection heuristics,
  constant-time admin auth, non-root Docker user, no secrets in source — full detail in `docs/SECURITY.md`.
- **Efficiency** — GenAI calls are skipped entirely when a deterministic answer is already complete (e.g.
  an all-clear crowd summary), capped `max_tokens`, short timeouts with bounded retries, an in-memory
  rate limiter with O(1) amortized cost.
- **Testing** — 69 automated tests, 94% coverage, explicit tests for the failure paths (AI provider down,
  service exceptions, malformed input, rate-limit trip) not just the happy path.
- **Accessibility** — skip link, full keyboard tab navigation (arrow keys + Home/End on the module rail),
  visible focus rings, `aria-live` regions for async results, high-contrast and text-size toggles,
  `prefers-reduced-motion` respected, semantic landmarks and labels throughout — detail in
  `docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md`.
- **Problem statement fit** — all seven named focus areas (navigation, crowd management, accessibility,
  transportation, sustainability, multilingual assistance, operational intelligence / real-time decision
  support) are implemented as *dedicated, working modules* — not just chat-only mentions — see the table in
  section 2.
